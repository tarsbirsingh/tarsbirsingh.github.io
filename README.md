Windows/Linux/ Mac PC with atleast i3 processor. Processor is expected to have atleast 4 cores with a clock speed of above 2Ghz. But as always the higher the better
4GB is the minimum required RAM. But I suggest using 8GB
1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution
2–4GB of disk space. This depends on the versions of Android SDKs and system images you install. For every system emulater you create you take about 1–2GB of the disk space
Java installed
Android Studio
